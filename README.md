## 📌 Project Description

Economic freedom is the fundamental right of every human to control their own labor and property. In an economically free society, individuals can work, produce, consume, and invest freely, with minimal government interference. This project visualizes the **Index of Economic Freedom**, which is compiled annually by **The Heritage Foundation**.

We analyze global trends in economic freedom using 12 indicators, grouped into four pillars:

1. **Rule of Law** – Property Rights, Government Integrity, Judicial Effectiveness  
2. **Government Size** – Government Spending, Tax Burden, Fiscal Health  
3. **Regulatory Efficiency** – Business Freedom, Labor Freedom, Monetary Freedom  
4. **Open Markets** – Trade Freedom, Investment Freedom, Financial Freedom
